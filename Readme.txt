Purpose:
The Purpose of this website will be to learn more about html, css and java script while converting these skills
and this learning process into something useful by creating a website which will act as my portfolio

Content:
This website should contain a home page acting as a directory to the website, a personal page about myself,
a page about my interests, a page about my experience and a page containing my projects with their documentation

Plan:
1. I will create a very basic github website that displays something simple such as "Hello World"
2. I would like to include my documentation on building the website on the website as well as my learning process and
perhaps a display of some features I've learned as I learn them. Therefore this will be the first pages I will create.
3. I will then create the basic website containing full content of what I describe in my content section.
4. I will then revise my website's code and layout and experiment with adding more features that I think may be
interesting or challenging.
