    <h2>Purpose:</h2>
    <p>The Purpose of this website will be to learn more about html, css and java script while converting these skills
        and this learning process into something useful by creating a website which will act as my portfolio</p>
    <h2>Content:</h2>
    <p>This website should contain a home page acting as a directory to the website, a personal page about myself,
        a page about my interests, a page about my experience and a page containing my projects with their documentation</p>
    <h2>Plan:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1. I will create a very basic github website that displays something simple such as "Hello World"</li>
        <li>2. I would like to include my documentation on building the website on the website as well as my learning process and</li>
        <li>perhaps a display of some features I've learned as I learn them. Therefore this will be the first pages I will create.</li>
        <li>3. I will then create the basic website containing full content of what I describe in my content section.</li>
        <li>4. I will then revise my website's code and layout and experiment with adding more features that I think may be interesting or challenging.</li>
    </ul>

<div notes>
<p>
    I will be using w3schools as a resource to learn html, javascript and css as I've found their content informative in the past and they cover all three languages. 
    First, I would like to learn HTML and the first part of HTML I'd like to learn is proper coding practices.

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html5_syntax.asp">W3 Coding Best Practice</a>
    <li>Always declare '!doctype html', 'lan="en"', viewport with device-width and 'meta charset="utf-8"' unless you have a reason not to</li>
    <li>Proper naming: lowercase, split with '-' and tag your elements</li>
    <li>Always close elements, even if not necissarily needed</li>
    <li>Qoute attribute values</li>
    <li>Always specify alt, width and height for images</li>
    <li>Focus on readability: no long lines, appropriate indentation</li>
</ol>
<ul techniques and features>
    <li>Use "li" to list items encompassed within "ul" or "ol" tag</li>
</ul>
