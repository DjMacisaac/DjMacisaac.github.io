    I will be using w3schools as a resource to learn html, javascript and css as I've found their content informative in the past and they cover all three languages. 
    First, I would like to learn HTML and the first part of HTML I'd like to learn is proper coding practices.
</p>
<ul html-coding-practices>
    <p>https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html5_syntax.asp</p>
    <li>1. Always declare '!doctype html', 'lan="en"', viewport with device-width and 'meta charset="utf-8"' unless you have a reason not to</li>
    <li>2. Proper naming: lowercase, split with '-' and tag your elements</li>
    <li>3. Always close elements, even if not necissarily needed</li>
    <li>4. Qoute attribute values</li>
    <li>5. Always specify alt, width and height for images</li>
    <li>6. Focus on readability: no long lines, appropriate indentation</li>
</ul>
<ul techniques and features>
    <li>Use "li" to list items encompassed within "ul" tag which stands for list and unordered list respectively</li>
</ul>
